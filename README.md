### **Madeleine's Tasks**
- home page
- individual product pages
- make sure all the button functions are working how they are intended
- calculate the price of product if buying multiple to add to cart --> i.e. 1 apple = 1.50, if you increase to 4 apples price displayed becomes 6
- order recieved page 
- slide delete on check out
### **Peter's Tasks**
- check out page
- removing individual quantity for checkout --> 4 apples is too much so able to decrease amount to 2 and price will adjust
- calculation of end price for all products in checkout
- payment page
- make sure all the button functions are working how they are intended
### **Challenges**
- There were issues with adjusting the calculation
- The product buttons as the top of the home page and the product buttons at the bottom of home page were not congruent at first and cause issue later on. This was fixed.
- After checkout it does not go to the home page
